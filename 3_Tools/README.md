There are numerous ways in which you can install the open-source chip design tools for this course. The simplest, "default" method is to use the pre-packaged Docker container provided by Harald Pretl's lab:

* IIC-OSIC-TOOLS: https://github.com/iic-jku/iic-osic-tools

Here are the EE 628 installation instructions by computer platform:  
* [Windows](win.md)  
* [Linux](linux.md)  
* [Mac](mac.md)  

If you are a "Liunx person," you can also install the tools from scratch. Below are a few references that would be useful to you in this endeavour.

Regardless of how you install the tools, you will occasionally need to look at their documentation. Here is a list of useful links.
