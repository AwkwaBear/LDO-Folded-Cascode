# LDO-Folded-Cascode

Reinforcement learning algorithm approach to optimizing component level variables for desired output utilizing the IHP PDK for 130nm process design.

This code is ported from the Skywater130-PDK to the IHP-PDK using the results research paper ***Design and Optimization of Low-Dropout Voltage Regulator Using Relational Graph Neural Network and Reinforcement Learning in Open-Source SKY130 Process*** using their code available [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1f6_NrRZsjMLZHOEuyuK3j5vdxhVVj50z?authuser=1)
