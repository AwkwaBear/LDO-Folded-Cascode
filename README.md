# LDO-Folded-Cascode

Reinforcement learning algorithm approach to optimizing component level variables for desired output utilizing the IHP PDK for 130nm process design.

This code is ported from the Skywater130-PDK to the IHP-PDK using the results research paper ***Design and Optimization of Low-Dropout Voltage Regulator Using Relational Graph Neural Network and Reinforcement Learning in Open-Source SKY130 Process*** using their code available [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ChrisZonghaoLi/sky130_ldo_rl/blob/main/python/ldo_rgcn_rl.ipynb)

The [IHP-PDK is linked here](https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/IHP-Open-PDK)

This work was completed for the course Electrical Engineering 628 - Analysis & Design of IC
